//Reverse

//2. Shift the Values

//A:Question:
//Given any array X, for example [2,1,6,4,-7], create an algorithm that shifts each number by one to the front.
// When your program is done the output for array [2,1,6,4,-7] should be [-7,4,6,1,2].

//B : Pseudocode:
    // 1. Write the reverse method of the array to reverse the values in the array.
    //3. Print the array in console.log.

//C: Code:
var x=[2,1,6,4,-7];
var reversed = x.reverse();
console.log(reversed);

//D: Diagram:
//The coding will shift the numbers by one to the front in the array by using the reverse method of the array.
// The output for the array should be [-7,4,6,1,2].
